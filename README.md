5. **Apply Special Membership**: Apply special membership status to the customer, enabling them to receive additional discounts.
6. **Exit**: Quit the program.

## How to Use:
1. **Compilation**: Compile the source code using any C++ compiler. For example, `g++ main.cpp -o msm_stores`.
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable. For example, `./msm_stores`.
3. **Interaction**: Follow the prompts displayed on the screen to navigate through the program, choose options, and perform actions.
4. **Termination**: Exit the program by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ library
